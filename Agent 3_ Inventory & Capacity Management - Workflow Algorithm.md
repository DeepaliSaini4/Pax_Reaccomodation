# **Agent 3: Inventory & Capacity Management \- Workflow Algorithm**

## **Algorithm Overview**

This agent determines whether sufficient reaccommodation capacity exists across all available resources to handle the disrupted passengers, working systematically from internal resources to external partnerships.

## **Input Requirements**

* **Passenger Summary Report** from Agent 2 containing:

  * Total passenger count requiring reaccommodation

  * Cabin class distribution (Economy/Business/First)

  * Destination breakdown by city/airport

  * Time sensitivity requirements (same-day vs next-day)

  * Special accommodation needs count

## **Step-by-Step Workflow Algorithm**

## **PHASE 1: REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS**

1. **Parse Passenger Summary**

   * Extract total passenger count

   * Categorize by cabin class requirements

   * Group by destination airports

   * Identify time-critical vs flexible passengers

   * Note special requirements (wheelchair, unaccompanied minors, etc.)

2. **Create Demand Matrix**

   * Build a structured demand table showing:

     * Destination A: X economy, Y business, Z first class seats needed

     * Destination B: X economy, Y business, Z first class seats needed

     * Time windows: Same-day vs next-day requirements

## **PHASE 2: INTERNAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT**

3. **Scan Own Airline Inventory**

   * Query reservation system for all flights to required destinations

   * Check available seats by cabin class for next 48 hours

   * Consider aircraft configuration constraints

   * Account for existing passenger loads and operational restrictions

4. **Calculate Internal Capacity**

   * Sum available seats per destination per cabin class

   * Apply operational buffers (crew rest, maintenance, weather contingencies)

   * Generate internal capacity matrix matching demand structure

5. **Perform Gap Analysis**

   * Compare demand matrix against internal capacity matrix

   * Identify shortfalls by destination and cabin class

   * Calculate percentage of passengers that can be accommodated internally

   * Flag critical gaps that require external solutions

## **PHASE 3: PARTNER NETWORK ACTIVATION**

6. **Assess Partnership Options**

   * If gaps exist, activate partner network scanning

   * Query codeshare partner availability for deficit routes

   * Check interline agreement partners for additional capacity

   * Verify reciprocal space availability agreements

7. **Partner Capacity Negotiation**

   * Contact partner airlines for real-time availability confirmation

   * Negotiate block space allocations if needed

   * Confirm pricing and booking procedures

   * Secure tentative holds on partner inventory

8. **Update Capacity Matrix**

   * Add confirmed partner capacity to availability matrix

   * Recalculate remaining gaps after partner contributions

   * Assess cost implications of partner utilization

## **PHASE 4: ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION EXPLORATION**

9. **Evaluate Alternative Transport**

   * If significant gaps remain, explore alternative options:

     * Nearby airport alternatives with ground transportation

     * Rail/bus combinations for short-haul routes

     * Charter aircraft for large group movements

     * Multi-modal transport solutions

10. **Next-Day Accommodation Strategy**

    * For passengers who cannot be accommodated same-day:

      * Check next-day capacity across all sources

      * Coordinate hotel accommodation requirements

      * Plan ground transportation logistics

      * Calculate total service recovery costs

## **PHASE 5: CAPACITY VALIDATION & OPTIMIZATION**

11. **Validate Total Capacity**

    * Confirm all capacity sources can deliver promised availability

    * Verify operational feasibility of proposed solutions

    * Check for scheduling conflicts or operational constraints

    * Ensure compliance with bilateral agreements and regulations

12. **Optimize Resource Allocation**

    * Prioritize own airline capacity (zero incremental cost)

    * Minimize partner airline usage (cost optimization)

    * Balance passenger convenience against operational costs

    * Consider downstream operational impacts

## **PHASE 6: CAPACITY REPORT GENERATION**

13. **Compile Comprehensive Capacity Assessment**

    * Document total reaccommodation capacity available

    * Break down by source (own airline, partners, alternatives)

    * Include cost estimates for each capacity source

    * Highlight any remaining unaccommodated passengers

14. **Generate Decision Recommendations**

    * Recommend optimal capacity utilization strategy

    * Identify cost-effective reaccommodation approaches

    * Flag high-risk or complex reaccommodation scenarios

    * Suggest escalation paths for unresolved capacity gaps

## **Output Deliverables**

* **Capacity Availability Report** showing total accommodation capability

* **Resource Allocation Strategy** prioritizing cost-effective solutions

* **Gap Analysis** identifying any unresolved passenger accommodation needs

* **Cost Impact Assessment** for financial planning and approval

* **Operational Feasibility Confirmation** for downstream execution

## **Decision Points**

* **Sufficient Capacity Available**: Proceed to Route Optimization (Agent 4\)

* **Partial Capacity Shortfall**: Escalate to executive decision for charter/alternative solutions

* **Critical Capacity Gap**: Activate emergency protocols and consider operational adjustments
